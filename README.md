# RickAndMortyWikiOfficial
Rick and Morty Wiki app project


<p>The fan made application for Rick and Morty TV series. Rick and Morty is created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Adult Swim. The data and images are used without claim of ownership and belong to their respective owners.
</p>
The app was created for educational purposes and so as a programming exercise for the android platform.
App displays characters that performed in the series and details about them, including picture and current status (alive or dead).
It was built based on The Rick and Morty API (or ShlaAPI) RESTful API created by Axel Fuhrmann (available at https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
<p></p>

Libraries used:
- retrofit 2
- gson
- okhttp
- picasso
- logging-interceptor
- cardview
- firebase (not used yet)

I tried to keep the code clean and stick to the MVP pattern, separating view from logic and data. 

App is not yet finished and is still in progress. Not all code is yet 100% clean and pretty, but most of it is. 
<p></p>

Still todo:
- cleaning
- favorite characters mark
- change for gridlayout when on bigger screens
- episodes list and details - 
- locations details (maybe also a list)
- bottom navigation bar for episodes / locations / characters
- random Rick and Morty quotes retrieved from firebase database
- tests
